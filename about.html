  <h1>About This Project</h1>

  <div class="content">
    <p>
      When Alice stepped through the looking glass in 1871, there were no telephones, light bulbs or phonographs.  <br><br>
      And yet, a mere 150 years later we carry our own looking glasses in our pocket that show us just about anything we'd like to see. <br><br>
      The idea of the tiny knitted QR code was inspired by Alice's first adventure. <br><br>
      As I worked through this project, I though of how Alice changed size and decided to pretend that my tools were not too small, it was simply I who was too large.<br><br>
      I built this project to serve as a window to updated calming views.  You may see snow, rain, hikers or animals.<br><br>
      Take a deep breath and enjoy a window, shared.<br>
    </p>

      <h2>How the Art Piece was Created</h2>
    
    <p>
      I had seen projects of people knitting QR codes into regularly sized knitting projects and knew it was possible.  <br><br>
      Admittedly, I had no idea if this would work out.<br><br>
      I started by using quilting pins and standard polyester sewing thread, just to see if I could even manage.  <br><br>
      There were many failed attempts at casting on the first evening, but I eventually got a swatch the size of my pinky nail. <br> <br>
      I changed colors and pins often trying to figure out what worked best.<br><br>
    </p>

  <img src="wip/wip1.jpg" alt="First Cast On" style="width:100%; border-radius:8px; margin:30px 0; box-shadow: 0 10px 30px rgba(0,0,0,0.08);">

  <img src="wip/wip2.jpg" alt="First Swatch" style="width:100%; border-radius:8px; margin:30px 0; box-shadow: 0 10px 30px rgba(0,0,0,0.08);">

      <p>
        OK, so I could knit small.  But could I do it cleanly enough to get it to scan?  The answer was NO, not initially.  <br><br>
        I tried to set myself up for the best success at the simplest QR code.  <br><br>
        I created a project in GitHub and did some planning before generating the bit.ly link and accompanying QR code.<br><br>
        My First attempt was flat fair isle with a contrasting color border.  My phone picked it up as text but would not scan or translate.<br><br>
        My Second attempt was flat fair isle with more border stitches.  This one wouldn't scan at all.<br><br>
        For my third attempt, I tried double-knitting, but the contrasting color showed through and it wouldn't scan at all.<br><br>
        For my final, successful attempt, I created small double pointed needles by cutting the heads off of my pins and sanding them down<br><br>
    </p>

      <img src="wip/wip3.jpg" alt="Pinned Swatch" style="width:100%; border-radius:8px; margin:30px 0; box-shadow: 0 10px 30px rgba(0,0,0,0.08);">

      <p>
        The final, successful attempt has a gauge of about 32 stitches x 32 rows per inch and took me about 4 hours to knit.<br><br>
        I was seriously considering pivoting my project because I hadn't felt like I'd made progress since my first attempt.<br><br>
        And then it scanned.<br><br>
      </p>

      <img src="wip/wip4.jpg" alt="It Scanned!" style="width:100%; border-radius:8px; margin:30px 0; box-shadow: 0 10px 30px rgba(0,0,0,0.08);">

      <p>
        From here, all that was left was to choose some of my favorite views to share and build out the rest of the project.<br><br>
      </p>

      <img src="wip/finished.png" alt="Done!!" style="width:100%; border-radius:8px; margin:30px 0; box-shadow: 0 10px 30px rgba(0,0,0,0.08);">

    <h3>How the Web Site was Created</h2>
    
    <p>
      I created a GitHub action to fetch updated images from a variety of National Park Services and US Geological Service static webcams once an hour.<br><br>
      Most of the cameras are in the continental US because I did not want viewers of this piece to be greeted with nighttime views.<br><br>
      The website itself just grabs one of the random images with a brief description.  I tried to select views that would change based on weather or time of day.<br><br>
      As I've worked on this project I've seen animals, hikers, and show.<br><br>
      Happy Viewing!<br><br>
